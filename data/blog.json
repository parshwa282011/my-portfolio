The teachers were talking about a project they wanted to start to help Jains, Vegetarians, and Vegans in finding food that they can eat in stores. We originally were planning on making a big spreadsheet with details of foods that were safe to eat for Jains, Vegetarians, and Vegans. I wondered if it would be much better and easier to access for people if we made it an app.</p><p>This idea led me to make the first version for the web at https://v1.stepstokindness.org — an original version where I added a few items and showed what potential this idea had.</p><p>I had it reviewed by my teachers who shared it with their supervisors, and they told me I should make a more functional version and develop the app. This is where I started my passion project.</p>"
